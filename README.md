# IoT-Enabled Smart Fuel Flow Meter

## Description
This project involves the development of an IoT-based smart fuel flow meter designed for real-time monitoring of fuel consumption. It utilizes flow sensors to capture fuel flow data, processes the data using an ESP32 microcontroller, and displays the real-time readings on an LED display.

## Features
- **Fuel Flow Measurement:** Captures accurate fuel flow data using flow sensors.
- **Data Processing:** Processes sensor data with the ESP32 microcontroller for real-time insights.
- **Real-Time Display:** Displays live fuel consumption readings on an LED display.
- **Efficient Monitoring:** Provides precise tracking for fuel management and monitoring.

## Components Used
- **Flow Sensor:** For measuring fuel flow.
- **ESP32 MCU:** To process the data and control the display.
- **LED Display:** To show real-time fuel flow readings.
- **Arduino:** For system control and integration.
