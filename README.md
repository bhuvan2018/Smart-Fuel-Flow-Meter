IoT-Enabled Smart Fuel Flow Meter
Description
This project involves the development of an IoT-based smart fuel flow meter designed for real-time monitoring of fuel consumption. It utilizes flow sensors to capture fuel flow data, processes the data using an ESP32 microcontroller, and displays the real-time readings on an LED display.

Features
Fuel Flow Measurement: Captures accurate fuel flow data using flow sensors.
Data Processing: Processes sensor data with the ESP32 microcontroller for real-time insights.
Real-Time Display: Displays live fuel consumption readings on an LED display.
Efficient Monitoring: Provides precise tracking for fuel management and monitoring.
Components Used
Flow Sensor: For measuring fuel flow.
ESP32 MCU: To process the data and control the display.
LED Display: To show real-time fuel flow readings.
Arduino: For system control and integration.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fuel-flow-meter.git
Connect the hardware components (Flow Sensor, ESP32, LED display).
Upload the code to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.
Usage
Once the system is set up and running, the fuel consumption data will be displayed on the LED display in real-time.
Monitor the fuel flow for precise readings and efficient fuel management.
